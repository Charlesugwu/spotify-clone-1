1. when refreshing the page, you can see the "alt" text for the buttons on the player. May have to go back to stying to fix.

QUESTIONS

after users register, will they be asked to confirm email address before logging in for the first time.
  - could put a message page stating "please check email for account confirmation."
  - or 
  - since register will automatically take user to login when complete, add message to login screen.
      - but will need to block them from signing in until email is confirmed.
      - then also have email link take user back to login page.
